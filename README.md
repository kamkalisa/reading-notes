###[Introduction](Introduction)
Hello, My name is Genisha. I am a single mom, a singer songwriter, an author, and a businesswoman. I am building my empire so that I can create generational wealth. Learning how to code is just one of the things I'm implementing to improve my portfolio. I look forward to learning about coding and using it to promote what I'm doing and create a lifestyle for others as well.
