# Introduction
- how computer works
- what makes a computer?
- how informations is represented using electricity?
- how computer use circuits? 
- 4 parts of the computer, inpout, output and store information
- what is code and how software controls hardware
## How computers work
- take input
- store information
- process
- output
Earliest computers were made of wood and medal
computers were electrical by 20th century but still slow
  - Input:
      - telling the computer what to do
      - using a keyboard
      - using a mouse
      - using touchscreen
      - using microphone
  - Output
      - depends on what a computer is designed to do
      - games
      - videos
      - photos
      - virutal reality
      - control a robot
      - communication between computers
       - output from one computer becomes input to the other computer
### Binary Data
   - ones and zeros play a big role on how computers work on the inside
   - single wire and it can be on or off
      - yes or no
      - true or false
      - on or off this is called a bit
      - more wires more bits
   - Binary system
      - only two digits 0 and 1
      - there are different positons
       - 10 position
       - 1 position
       - 100 position
       - 1000 position, etc.
   - Each position carries a value
   - Instead of multiplying by ten each time we multiply by 2
      - 1s 2s 4s 8s
      - The number nine in binary is 1001
      - 1x8+0x4+0x2+1x1
   - Any number can be represented with 1s and 0s
   - The more wires, the more numbers you cans store
   - Text,images, and sound can also be represented with numbers
   - You can store letters as numbers to represent any word
   - Sound is a series of vibrations
   - sound is represented by waveform and can be broken down into numbers
   - more bits means a higher range of numbers
 #### Circuits and Logic
- circuitry is an artform and you can use circuits for creative ideas
- tiny components that enable a computer to read the input and give the proper output
- Not: the signal that goes in is not the signal that comes out
- complicated circuits take multiple signals and combine them to give different results
  - if signal coming in is a 0 then the result is 0
  - And: a signal that gives a 1 if both (first and second) signals are a 1
- Logic gates
  - And
  - nand
  - not
  - nor
  - or
  - xor
- Adder: you can add two bits together
  - takes in two bits whether one or zero
  - adds them together to get the sum
   - 0+0=00
   - 0+1=01
   - 1+1=10
- mulitiple adders can be used to create more numbers
- The smaller the circuit is, the less distance it has to go
### CPU, Memory, Input & Output
- Input
  - when you press the letter b
  - keyboard converts the letter to a number
  - that number is sent as binary ones and zeros
  - cpu calculates how to display the letter b pixel by pixel
  - follows step by step instructions from memory on how to draw the letter b
  - finally the pixel is sent to the screen
- Output
  - speaker plays sound
  - printer will print object
  - can control physical motion i.e. robotic arm
## How Computers work: Hardware & Software
- Hardware
  - wires
  - chips
  - circuits
  - speakers
  - plugs
- Software
  - programs or code running on the machine
  - can be processing games to web pages
 - How do hardware and software communicate
  - Central processing unit (CPU)
    - master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer
    - has smaller simpler parts that handle simple task
 - Binary code would take forever
 - programs are much better now
 - software tells cpu what to do
- Operating system
  - the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of the computer
  - special abilities that let us control the other software on the computer
