Why People Visit
YOUR Website
Key Motivations
● Are they looking for general
entertainment or do they
need to achieve a specific
goal?
● If there is a specific goal, is
it a personal or professional
one?
● Do they see spending time on
this activity as essential or a
luxury?
Specific Goals
● Do they want general
information / research (such
as background on a topic /
company), or are they after
something specific (such as a
particular fact or information
on a product)?
● Are they already familiar with
the service or product that
you offer or do they need to
be introduced to it?
● Are they looking for time
sensitive information, such as
the latest news or updates on
a particular topic?
● Do they want to discover
information about a specific
product or service to help
them decide whether to buy
it or not?
● Do they need to contact you?
If so, can they visit in person
(which might require opening
hours and a map)? Or might
they need email or telephone
contact details?
Getting your message
across using design
CONTENT
Web pages often have a lot of
information to communicate.
For example, the pages of
online newspapers will have
information that does not appear
on every page of the print
equivalent:
● A masthead or logo
● Links to navigate the site
● Links to related content and
other popular articles
● Login or membership options
● Ability for users to comment
● Copyright information
● Links to privacy policies,
terms and conditions,
advertising information, RSS
feeds, subscription options
With so much on the page, the
designer needs to organize and
prioritize the information to
communicate their message
and help users find what they're
looking for.
Prioritizing
If everything on a page appeared
in the same style, it would be
much harder to understand. (Key
messages would not stand out.)
By making parts of the page
look distinct from surrounding
content, designers draw
attention to (or away from)
those items.
Designers create something
known as a visual hierarchy
to help users focus on the key
messages that will draw people's
attention, and then guide them
to subsequent messages.
We look at visual hierarchy on
pages 467-468.
Organizing
Grouping together related
content into blocks or chunks
makes the page look simpler
(and easier to understand).
Users should be able to
identify the purpose of each
block without processing each
individual item.
By presenting certain types of
information in a similar visual
style (such as using the same
style for all buttons or all links),
users will learn to associate that
style with a particular type of
content.
